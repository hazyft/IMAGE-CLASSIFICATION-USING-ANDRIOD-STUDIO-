PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Image classification is the process of assigning labels to images according to 
their types.
So, when we provide image of given category to image classification system, 
the system will assign label to images according to the category
The main motive of this project is to predict the image and displays the name of 
the item, which matches with the real world assigned name.
Develop an image classification application using Android Studio that can 
accurately classify images into their respective categories.

SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
Android Studio:
Android studio is the official integrated Development (IDE) for android 
application development. It is based on the Intellij IDEA , a Java 
integrated development environment for software, and incorporates its 
code editing and developer tools.
Android Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for

applications.

IMAGE CLASSIFICATION 
The objective of image classification is the automatic allocation of image to 
thematic classes . Two types of classification are supervised classification and
